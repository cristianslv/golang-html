# Golang HTML

#### This project stores a "simple" way to use Go with HTML. I built a To-Do list.

#### I did not followed a course or a blog page to build this project, that's something I'm very proud of.

- You must have Go installed →

```bash
$ go version

go version go1.15.5 linux/amd64
```

- Make sure to have the right folder structure to run these files.

```bash
$ pwd

/home/you/go/src/github.com/golang
```

- You need to run the server →

```bash
$ go run /server/main.go
```

- Then, just access localhost →

```bash
$ http://localhost:5000
```
